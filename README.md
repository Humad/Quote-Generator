# Quote-Generator
A Free Code Camp challenge, but with back-end support.

This was originally a Front-End FreeCodeCamp challenge that used scripts to display a random quote. 
I decided to work on my back-end skills, and added support so that it connects to my hosted database and returns all the quotes stored there.

Created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, NodeJS, and ExpressJS.

If you would like to add to the database of quotes, send me a message. I will provide you with user details that will allow you to add to the database using the addNewQuotes.ejs file.
