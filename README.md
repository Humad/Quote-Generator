# Quote-Generator
An API that allows fetching random quotes. Helpful for testing beginner projects that need to connect to the internet.

This was originally a Front-End FreeCodeCamp challenge that used scripts to display a random quote. 
I decided to work on my back-end skills, and added support so that it connects to my hosted database and returns all the quotes stored there.

Created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, NodeJS, and ExpressJS.

[Live version](https://getquote.herokuapp.com)

Making a GET request to https://getquote.herokuapp.com/get will return some quotes from my database. I use this when I'm playing around with new things and I want to create a simple app that fetches some data and displays it.
