# Quote-Generator
A Free Code Camp challenge, but with back-end support.

This was originally a Front-End FreeCodeCamp challenge that used scripts to display a random quote. 
I decided to work on my back-end skills, and added support so that it connects to my hosted database and returns all the quotes stored there.

Created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, NodeJS, and ExpressJS.
